Each Zonta Club in District 2 solicits applications from high school juniors and\r\nseniors in its area. In the spring, each club selects a club award winner. A winner will be chosen\r\nby the Zonta Club of Ottawa and a cash award will be presented to the awardee at the Zonta\r\nAwards Reception in May.\r\nEach club winner becomes a District finalist. The District Award Winner will be announced at the\r\nend of the academic year and the award will be presented at a Zonta District 2 Conference or\r\nSeminar in October.\r\nHow will the applications be reviewed? The applications will be reviewed by a committee of\r\nZonta Club of Ottawa members. Supporting documentation not requested will not be\r\nconsidered. All applications and supporting information become the property of the Zonta Club\r\nof Ottawa. The Zonta Club of Ottawa has final authority over any aspect of the Awards.\r\nWho was Jean M. Coon? Jean M. Coon joined the Zonta Club of Saratoga County in 1962,\r\ntransferring from the Zonta Club of Syracuse. She served as the Governor of District 2 and was\r\nParliamentarian of the Zonta International Board from 1979-1980. She served as Chairman of\r\nthe Zonta International By-Law Committee. An active member of her Ballston Spa community,\r\nher humanitarian efforts were always with a small \u201ch\u201d and never self-serving. Good things just\r\nhappened, and most people never knew that Jean was the impetus behind the results. In 1982,\r\nJean died at age 52. Shortly thereafter, District 2 established the District 2 Jean M. Coon\r\nHumanitarian Award to honour her many achievements.\r\nHow to apply\r\nApplication forms may be printed or downloaded from the Zonta Club of Ottawa\u2019s Website\r\n(www.zontaottawa.ca).

It must be clear and coherent, and it must answer the question that has been put forth on the application.2. The essay must offer supporting evidence. The writer must provide the supporting evidence in paragraph (not \u201cbullet\u201d or list) form. Each paragraph must contain evidence that supports one idea or concept that proves the thesis statement. The writer must provide citations (in footnote, endnote, or paranthetical form) for all evidence presented.3. Every essay must follow basic rules of format and grammar. Every paper must contain a beginning (introductory paragraph), a middle (several supporting paragraphs that comprise the body of the paper), and an end (concluding paragraph). Grammar is vital for essay composition. Sentence fragments, misspellings, and improper punctuation denote a carelessly-written and poorly-conceived paper.",

The Community Foundation of Ottawa maintains the fund. \u00a0The award is subsequently forwarded to an accredited educational institution in the name of the successful candidate who has met the compulsory criteria and has been recommended by the selection committee, in the given year. \u00a0There have been exceptions to this in previous years when the student's tuition was covered by other means and the award was instead used for school related fees.",

Dick was a well-respected inspector for Worksafe BC, who was a tireless advocate for blasting safety. He died of a heart attack in 2007 shortly before he was due to retire.The scholarship will be awarded to a full-time student attending a college or university in Canada (including Yukon and North West Territories) who is studying a subject with some relevance to the non-military use of explosives or blasting (e.g. mining, civil, or chemical engineering; geology; seismic exploration; avalanche control; blasting physics). We are flexible about the subject providing the applicant has an interest in pursuing a career that could involve blasting. Studies may be at any level (i.e. certificate, diploma, bachelors, masters, or doctorate). The applicant does not need to have any link to the Chapter or explosives industry and does not need to come from Western Canada. Also eligible would be a student who has been studying in Canada but is in the process of transferring elsewhere (e.g. moving to U of M Rolla, South Dakota, or Montana Tech.) providing the subject is very relevant to explosives or blasting. Again, we are not particularly interested in the student's GPA, but he or she must be in good standing. Candidates leaving high school and moving directly to further studies are also eligible.",

It encompasses all manner of goods and services shared or exchanged for both monetary and nonmonetary benefit.\u201d\r\nThe sharing economy has fundamentally changed the way people think about traditional ways of transportation and vacation stays. In 2014, it was recorded that AirBnb hosted more guests on an annual basis than the infamous Hilton Worldwide chain. In New York alone, \u201cbetween 2012-2013, over 400,000 Airbnb guests visited New York City  generating over $632 million in economic activity in the city.\u201d Similarly, by 2015, only a few short years after its inception, Uber was active in over 250 cities worldwide and had completed over 1 billion rides \u2013 fundamentally changing the taxi industry as we know it.\r\nAlthough synonymous with Uber and Airbnb, the sharing economy continues to break boundaries and drastically shape different industries in ways regulators and policy makers never could have imagined. Such disruption has forced regulators around the world to conceptualize ways to integrate consumer protection regulations into the sharing economy. However, as noted by Koopman et al., \u201cthe key contribution of the sharing economy is that it has overcome market imperfections without recourse to traditional forms of regulation.\u201d",

The idea of\nraising the minimum wage in Canada and in some jurisdictions in the United\nStates is a contentious topic. Proponents of a higher minimum wage tout that\nsuch increase will be an effective tool for helping those in poverty. But a\nrecent study by the Fraser Institute found that 88% of minimum wage earners in\nCanada do not actually live in low-income households. In fact, nearly 60% of\nthese earners are young adults aged 15-24, most of whom are living with their\nparents or other relatives. Additionally, research has found that about 70% of\nthe benefits from a higher wage go to non-poor households in Canada. Beyond\nthe misperception that the majority of the benefits from an increase in the\nminimum wage would go to low-income earners and the most vulnerable, raising\nthe minimum wage has been shown to lead to reductions in employment,\nparticularly for young people and immigrants.\n#\n#</p>\n\n<h1>About<a href=\"https://www.fraserinstitute.org/\">FraserInstitute</a></h1>\n\n<p>The Fraser\nInstitute is an independent, non-partisan research and educational\norganization based in Canada.
